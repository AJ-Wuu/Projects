OCI Console for an Oracle Autonomous Database cannot increase network bandwidth.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: Provide high availability and scalability. Provide complete lifecycle automation. Enable to run everything from small VMs to large bare metal clusters. Support Bare Metal DB Systems, Virtual Machine and Exadata systems.
Operations included in automated data center operations: Provisioning a database. Patching a database. Online backups of a database. Automatically handling failures and errors. 
Autonomous Transaction Processing: Data is stored in row format, Missing indexes are detected and created. It is used for OLTP and mixed workloads. Response time is optimized for queries.
Autonomous Data Warehouse: Data is stored in columnar format. Complex SQL queries are optimized.

Autonomous Database allows to: 
    Start instance instantly.
    Stop instance on demand to conserve resources and pause billing.
    Scale instance on demand without tedious manual steps.
    (All can be done through clicking in the console.)
Provisioning: 
    Highly scalable, secure and available. 
    Private software-defined network.
    Fully encrypted database.
    Scalable RAC Cluster running on Exadata.
    Configures automatic processes like Backup.
    Choose the number of CPUs and the storage size in terabytes.
    Filter up to 20 different metrics for available, stopped and backup databases.
Provisioning ADB: 
    Extremely fast and easy.
    Require number of CPUs, database name, and workload type.
    No need to specify tablespaces, file system, operating system, or initialization parameters.
    Self-contained, self-secure, self-managed, scalable.
Scaling: (These two scaling can be done separately without influencing each other)
    Scale up/down CPU. 
    Scale up/down Storage.
Auto Scaling: (Enabled by default except for always-free account)
    Increase up to three times of the base number of OCPUs (up to 33 in total).
    All the settings can be changed while the database is still running, no down time require.
    Does not change the concurrency and parallelism settings for the predefined services.
    Billed based on the average number of OCPUs consumed during an hour.
ADB autonomously and continuously monitors the overall system performance.
Moving ADB:
    ADB shared resources can be moved from one compartment to another. Backups will be moved as well.
    Require appropriate privileges in the compartments.
    After moving, inherent policies apply immediately and affect access to that resource and its dependent resources through the console.
Cloning: 
    Possible to create a new ADB as a clone of an existing ADB, as a full copy or only metadata, 
        from a live running database instance or a backup of the source, 
        as a refreshable (read-only) clone (can trail the source DB for up to 7 days; becomes read-only after this period).
    ADB can be configured to use Private endpoints by cloning from an existing ADB with Public endpoints.
Managing Users: 
    DWROLE (), specify only password, the DB password will not expire for 360 days by default, DWROLE includes all the necessary privileges for a DW developer / user.
    Possible to create a DB user by logging in to the SQL Developer Web console as an ADMIN user for the event that there is no database client software configured.
Alarms and Events: 
    Events including Admin password expiration, ADB services going down, Wallet expiration warnings, etc.
    Notification service provided broadcast messages to distributed components using a publish-subscribe model 
        (event rules, alarms are triggered or directly publish a message). 
    Topic is a communication channel for sending messages to the subscriptions in the topic (topics and their subscriptions can be managed.)
Manage ADB backup and restores: 
    Automatic backup.
    Retention period 60 days.
    Can be restores / recovered any time.
    Manual backups possible --
        using OCI Object Storage --
            create bucket to hold backups, the name format must follow “backup_<databasename>” (NOT the display name), all in lower-case
            set OCI Object Storage tenancy URL, add the database default_backup_bucket property
            define OCI Object Storage credentials inside the database, add the database property default_credential
        manual backup configuration task is a one-time operation.
    Recovery using cloud console. Automatic restore / recover.
Autonomous Data Guard:
    Monitors primary database.
    If ADB goes down, standby instance automatically assumes primary instance role.
    Failover from primary to standby is seamless.
    After failover, a new standby for primary is automatically provisioned.
    Currently, standby database created in same region as primary database.
    For better resilience, the standby database is provisioned: 
        in regions with more than one availability domain, 
            the standby database is provisioned automatically in a different availability domain than the primary database
        in regions with a single availability domain, 
            the standby database is provisioned automatically on a different physical machine than the primary database
    Automatic Failover Scenario: 
        If Primary is unavailable, Switchover button turns to a Failover one;
        No user action needed;
        Automatic failover allowed only when no data loss will occur;
        RTO (Recovery Time Objective) = 2 minutes and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) = 0 minutes.
    Manual Failover Scenario: 
        If failover is unsuccessful, Switchover button turns into a Failover button and user can trigger a Manual Failover;
        System automatically recovers as much data as possible;
        Manual recommended only in a true disaster scenario;
        RTO = 2 minutes, RPO = 5 minutes.
Q1  The capabilities of OADB that can accelerate innovation:
    Provisions a data warehouse in seconds
    Built-in AI and ML helps find patterns that could identify undiscovered anomalies
    Instant scaling of storage
    NOT Scaling of CPUs with very little downtime

Dedicated Infrastructure:
    Two deployment choices --
        Shared Infrastructure (Public Cloud), Ultra-Simple, Standardized Config and Lifecycle Policies
        Dedicated Infrastructure (Public Cloud or Customer’s Data Center), Customizable, IT Specifies Config and Lifecycle Policies
    Primary Benefits -- 
        Provides private Database Cloud running on dedicated Exadata Infrastructure, 
        Highest Isolation, 
        Customizable Operational Policies. 
    Dedicated allows multiple levels of isolation: 
        DB, Container DB, VM Cluster, Secure Isolation Zone within public cloud, Separate Hardware (Exadata Infrastructure).
    Autonomous Management Model: 
        Customer controls DB users, schemas and encryption keys;
        Oracle owns, manages and controls (without customer access) DomU, container DBs, Hypervisor, DB servers, storage servers, network, etc.
    Dedicated Network Architecture:
        Full Virtual Cloud Network support,
        Cloud compute native connections, 
        Customer corporate network connections, 
        Microsoft Azure secure cross-cloud interconnect.
    ExadataCloud@Customer:
        Address even stricter data security and sovereignty 
            by delivering high-performance Exadata Cloud services capabilities in the customer’s data center behind the customer’s own firewall.
        Primary Benefits --
            Same service as ADB Dedicated running on Public Cloud;
            Same simplicity, agility, performance and elasticity;
            Simplest and fastest transition to Autonomous Cloud; Easily migrate existing on-premises databases;
            Existing apps in data center simply reconnect and run;
            No application changes needed; Data never leaves the customer’s data center.
        Two lightweight Cloud Control Plane Servers in every ExaC@C rack communicate to the public cloud; Local Control Plane consolidates all cloud management.
        Simple Connectivity to the Data Center Network --
            Directly connect to the customer's network to communicate with application servers (10Gbps/25Gbps fiber or 10Gbps cooper);
            Connect via standard switches just like on-premises Exadata (can optionally place switches inside the Exadata rack);
            Customers control the client network configuration (support for flexiblie VLAN configurations; separate client application and backup networks).
        Resilience to disrupted OCI connectivity --
            Preserved functionality -- 
                Customer access to databases
                Automated backups
                Auto scaling
            Suspended functionality -- 
                Infrastructure management (Manual OCPU scaling, VM cluster creation)
                Management via OCI interfaces (Web UI, OCI CLI, REST API/SDK, Terraform)
                Oracle Cloud Ops access to perform
        Encryption --
            All Oracle Autonomous databases encrypt data at rest.
            Data is automatically encrypted as it's written to the storage.
            Encryption is transparent to authorized users and applications (database automatically decrypts the data when it's being read from the storage).
        Options for backing up the Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer --
            using a ZDLRA (Zero-Data Loss Recovery Appliance)
            locally mounted NFS storage
            Oracle Public Cloud
