Autonomous Transaction Processing: It is used for OLTP and mixed workloads; Missing indexes are detected and created; Data is stored in row format
Two actions that can be performed from the OCI Console for an Oracle Autonomous Database: Scale up/down CPU; Increase Storage allocated for Database
In Autonomous Data Warehouse: Data is stored in columnar format
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: It provides complete lifecycle automation; It enables you to run everything from small VMs to large bare metal clusters; It provides high availability and scability
Operations are included in automated data center operations: Provisioning a database; Patching a database; Online backups of a database; Automatically handling failures and errors

OCI Console for an Oracle Autonomous Database cannot increase network bandwidth.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: Provide high availability and scalability. Provide complete lifecycle automation. Enable to run everything from small VMs to large bare metal clusters. Support Bare Metal DB Systems, Virtual Machine and Exadata systems.
Operations included in automated data center operations: Provisioning a database. Patching a database. Online backups of a database. Automatically handling failures and errors. 
Autonomous Transaction Processing: Data is stored in row format, Missing indexes are detected and created. It is used for OLTP and mixed workloads. Response time is optimized for queries.
Autonomous Data Warehouse: Data is stored in columnar format. Complex SQL queries are optimized.

Autonomous Database allows to: 
    Start instance instantly.
    Stop instance on demand to conserve resources and pause billing.
    Scale instance on demand without tedious manual steps.
    (All can be done through clicking in the console.)
Provisioning: 
    Highly scalable, secure and available. 
    Private software-defined network.
    Fully encrypted database.
    Scalable RAC Cluster running on Exadata.
    Configures automatic processes like Backup.
    Choose the number of CPUs and the storage size in terabytes.
    Filter up to 20 different metrics for available, stopped and backup databases.
Provisioning ADB: 
    Extremely fast and easy.
    Require number of CPUs, database name, and workload type.
    No need to specify tablespaces, file system, operating system, or initialization parameters.
    Self-contained, self-secure, self-managed, scalable.
Scaling: (These two scaling can be done separately without influencing each other)
    Scale up/down CPU. 
    Scale up/down Storage.
Auto Scaling: (Enabled by default except for always-free account)
    Increase up to three times of the base number of OCPUs (up to 33 in total).
    All the settings can be changed while the database is still running, no down time require.
    Does not change the concurrency and parallelism settings for the predefined services.
    Billed based on the average number of OCPUs consumed during an hour.
ADB autonomously and continuously monitors the overall system performance.
Moving ADB:
    ADB shared resources can be moved from one compartment to another. Backups will be moved as well.
    Require appropriate privileges in the compartments.
    After moving, inherent policies apply immediately and affect access to that resource and its dependent resources through the console.
Cloning: 
    Possible to create a new ADB as a clone of an existing ADB, as a full copy or only metadata, 
        from a live running database instance or a backup of the source, 
        as a refreshable (read-only) clone (can trail the source DB for up to 7 days; becomes read-only after this period).
    ADB can be configured to use Private endpoints by cloning from an existing ADB with Public endpoints.
Managing Users: 
    DWROLE (), specify only password, the DB password will not expire for 360 days by default, DWROLE includes all the necessary privileges for a DW developer / user.
    Possible to create a DB user by logging in to the SQL Developer Web console as an ADMIN user for the event that there is no database client software configured.
Alarms and Events: 
    Events including Admin password expiration, ADB services going down, Wallet expiration warnings, etc.
    Notification service provided broadcast messages to distributed components using a publish-subscribe model 
        (event rules, alarms are triggered or directly publish a message). 
    Topic is a communication channel for sending messages to the subscriptions in the topic (topics and their subscriptions can be managed.)
Manage ADB backup and restores: 
    Automatic backup.
    Retention period 60 days.
    Can be restores / recovered any time.
    Manual backups possible --
        using OCI Object Storage --
            create bucket to hold backups, the name format must follow “backup_<databasename>” (NOT the display name), all in lower-case
            set OCI Object Storage tenancy URL, add the database default_backup_bucket property
            define OCI Object Storage credentials inside the database, add the database property default_credential
        manual backup configuration task is a one-time operation.
    Recovery using cloud console. Automatic restore / recover.
Autonomous Data Guard:
    Monitors primary database.
    If ADB goes down, standby instance automatically assumes primary instance role.
    Failover from primary to standby is seamless.
    After failover, a new standby for primary is automatically provisioned.
    Currently, standby database created in same region as primary database.
    For better resilience, the standby database is provisioned: 
        in regions with more than one availability domain, 
            the standby database is provisioned automatically in a different availability domain than the primary database
        in regions with a single availability domain, 
            the standby database is provisioned automatically on a different physical machine than the primary database
    Automatic Failover Scenario: 
        If Primary is unavailable, Switchover button turns to a Failover one;
        No user action needed;
        Automatic failover allowed only when no data loss will occur;
        RTO (Recovery Time Objective) = 2 minutes and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) = 0 minutes.
    Manual Failover Scenario: 
        If failover is unsuccessful, Switchover button turns into a Failover button and user can trigger a Manual Failover;
        System automatically recovers as much data as possible;
        Manual recommended only in a true disaster scenario;
        RTO = 2 minutes, RPO = 5 minutes.
Q2.1 The capabilities of OADB that can accelerate innovation:
     Provisions a data warehouse in seconds
     Built-in AI and ML helps find patterns that could identify undiscovered anomalies
     Instant scaling of storage
     NOT Scaling of CPUs with very little downtime

Dedicated Infrastructure:
    Two deployment choices --
        Shared Infrastructure (Public Cloud), Ultra-Simple, Standardized Config and Lifecycle Policies
        Dedicated Infrastructure (Public Cloud or Customer’s Data Center), Customizable, IT Specifies Config and Lifecycle Policies
    Primary Benefits -- 
        Provides private Database Cloud running on dedicated Exadata Infrastructure, 
        Highest Isolation, 
        Customizable Operational Policies. 
    Dedicated allows multiple levels of isolation: 
        DB, Container DB, Virtual Cloud Network (VCN), VM Cluster, Secure Isolation Zone within public cloud, Separate Hardware (Exadata Infrastructure).
    Autonomous Management Model: 
        Customer controls DB users, schemas and encryption keys;
        Oracle owns, manages and controls (without customer access) DomU, container DBs, Hypervisor, DB servers, storage servers, network, etc.
    Dedicated Network Architecture:
        Full Virtual Cloud Network support,
        Cloud compute native connections, 
        Customer corporate network connections, 
        Microsoft Azure secure cross-cloud interconnect.
    ExadataCloud@Customer:
        Address even stricter data security and sovereignty 
            by delivering high-performance Exadata Cloud services capabilities in the customer’s data center behind the customer’s own firewall.
        Primary Benefits --
            Same service as ADB Dedicated running on Public Cloud;
            Same simplicity, agility, performance and elasticity;
            Simplest and fastest transition to Autonomous Cloud; Easily migrate existing on-premises databases;
            Existing apps in data center simply reconnect and run;
            No application changes needed; Data never leaves the customer’s data center.
        Two lightweight Cloud Control Plane Servers in every ExaC@C rack communicate to the public cloud; Local Control Plane consolidates all cloud management.
        Simple Connectivity to the Data Center Network --
            Directly connect to the customer's network to communicate with application servers (10Gbps/25Gbps fiber or 10Gbps cooper);
            Connect via standard switches just like on-premises Exadata (can optionally place switches inside the Exadata rack);
            Customers control the client network configuration (support for flexiblie VLAN configurations; separate client application and backup networks).
        Resilience to disrupted OCI connectivity --
            Preserved functionality -- 
                Customer access to databases
                Automated backups
                Auto scaling
            Suspended functionality -- 
                Infrastructure management (Manual OCPU scaling, VM cluster creation)
                Management via OCI interfaces (Web UI, OCI CLI, REST API/SDK, Terraform)
                Oracle Cloud Ops access to perform
        Encryption --
            All Oracle Autonomous databases encrypt data at rest.
            Data is automatically encrypted as it's written to the storage.
            Encryption is transparent to authorized users and applications (database automatically decrypts the data when it's being read from the storage).
        Options for backing up the Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer --
            using a ZDLRA (Zero-Data Loss Recovery Appliance)
            locally mounted NFS storage
            Oracle Public Cloud
Describe Workflows and Functionality: 
    Autonomous Private DB Cloud (typical) -- 
        Fleet Administrator provisions the Exadata infrastructure by specifying its size, availability domain, and region within the Oracle Cloud; 
        Partitions system by provisioning clusters and container databases; 
        Developers, DBAs and users provision databases within container databases using self-service tools; 
        Just specify DB compute (OCPUs) and storage; 
        Billing based on the size of the Exadata infrastructure (quarter, half or full rack) and the number of CPUs that are being consumed;
        Allow customers to use their existing Oracle database licenses with this service to reduce the cost.
    Autonomous Database Dedicated --
        Physical Characteristics and Constraints – support Exadata infrastructure models and shapes X7, X8, and X8M in either a quarter, half or full Exadata rack.

        Fleet and DBS user role setup; 
        Private Cloud setup; 
        Provide self-service access to end users to create and use Autonomous Databases.
    General Selection Considerations -- 
        Must subscribe to an Exadata Infrastructure (min term 48 hours); 
        Include Availability Domain placement controls for latency-sensitive apps; 
        Policy controls for patch scheduling and software versioning; 
        Database migration via export and import from Object Store, 
        Data Pump direct import – Network link, Golden Gate; 
        Cloning and Auto Scaling capabilities are automatically available.

Monitoring Dedicated Infrastructure: 
    Autonomous Database Management Capabilities --
        Automates most tasks for the infrastructure DBA.
        Apps DBA still needs to monitor, diagnose, and perform basic application-level administrative operations. 
        EM / Performance Hub / OCI Console provides management capabilities for 
            database movement and cloning, 
            monitoring and alerting, 
            deep performance diagnostics and troubleshooting, 
            performance and capacity insights based on historical data.
    ADB-Dedicated Database Operations Available on Cloud Control Plane --
        All administrative database actions are exposed through the UI and REST APIs --
            Database, CDB, Cluster, or Exadata create / delete / start / stop, 
            On-demand backup and restore, 
            Scale CPU, storage or other resources, 
            Download connection information, including wallet, for encrypted connections, 
            Schedule updates for Exadata Infrastructure, VM Cluster, or Container Database.
        Performance monitoring, scripting and schema design through SQL Developer --
            Performance Hub and OCI Metrics and Notifications in Native Oracle Cloud Console, 
            Can also monitor databases using existing Enterprise Manager Grid Control deployments.
Creating OCI Policies for Autonomous Dedicated:
    Fleet Administrators -- 
        Fleet Admin provisions resources using 
            GUI or APIs (Allocates budgets (service limits) by Compartment to the organizations), 
            Exadata Infrastructure (Specifies Name, Region, AD, Size), 
            Clusters (single cluster v1), 
            Container Databases (CDB) in Clusters (Specifies Name, Software Version, Service Level (eg. Data Guard))
    Database Administrators -- 
        Create, monitor and manage ADBs to create an access ADBs DBAs need, 
        Oracle Cloud Account with necessary permissions to create and access Autonomous Database, Autonomous Backups, Autonomous Container Databases
    Developers and Users -- 
        Do not required Oracle Cloud account, 
        Use Network Connectivity and credentials to connect to ADB, the authorization information given to them by the DBAs, 
        Securely connect to Autonomous DB using pre-defined services.
    Service Lifecycle that can be managed -- 
        Budget and Capacity Planning, 
        Provision and Partition Infrastructure, 
        LOB Self Service, 
        Operate Auto-Scale, Auto-Tune, Auto-Backup, 
        Maintain Update, 
        Monitor
    Dedicated Private Cloud Fleet and DB Admin IAM (Identity Access Management) setup --
        Resource can be one of autonomous-exadata-infrastructure, autonomous-container-databases, autonomous-databases, autonomous-backups
    Policy statement -- 
        allow group <GROUP> to <VERB> <RESOURCE> in compartment <COMPARTMENT>
        Group is a set of users with the same privileges.
        Compartment is an operating context for a specific set of service resources only accessible to GROUPs who are explicitly granted access.
        Policy is used to bind privileges for a GROUP to a specific set of resources in a COMPAREMENT.
        Levels of access can be defined by policy -- manage, inspect, read, use.
Manage Maintenance Scheduling (Patching, ADB-Dedicated Update Policy): 
    Oracle is responsible for all software update operations.
    The database is continuously available to the application – 
        Updates applied across RAC nodes and Exadata storage servers. 
        Applications using Application Continuity best practices run without interruption.
    Quarterly updates of all components (Firmware, OS, Storage, Network, Hypervisor, Clusterware, Database).
    Updates automatically scheduled based on customer preferences.
Managing Encryption Keys:
    Techiniques --
        TDE tablespace encryption for all data at rest
        TLS 1.2 and Native Network encryption
        HSM-based Key Management Service in OCI
        Integration with on-premises Oracle Key Vault for ADB-ExaC@C
    Customer-Controlled Encryption Key Management --
        Master Encryption Keys stored on external HSM device.
            FIPS-140 Security Level 3 Compliant Service
        Customers control key generation and rotation.
        Each ACD and ADB has a separate MEK.
        Key Management is transparent to the ADB user for simpler developer experience.
    End-to-End Data Protection --
        Transparent Data Encryption
        Oracle TLS 1.2 and Native Network Encryption
        Database Vault
Q3.1 Create an Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure resource requires the input of Shape, Availability Domain, VCN (NO storage).
Q3.2 Actions can be performed from the Autonomous Container Database (CDB) details page: 
     Change maintenance schedule, Move CDB to a different compartment, Change backup retention policy for CDB, Restart CDB.


Migration Options and Considerations:
    Optimizer statistics gathering --
        ADW and ATP -- Statistics gathered automatically during direct-path load operations
        ADW and ATP -- Users can gather statistics manually if needed
        ATP -- Statistics are gathered automatically as data changes
    Hints -- Optimizer and Parallel Hints ignored by default
    Some database options / features are locked
    ADW -- Managing DML Performance and Compression
        ADW uses Hybrid Columnar Compressions for all tables by default.
        It's recommended to use bulk operations like direct-path loads and CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statements.
        Compression can be avoided with the "nocompress" create table keyword.
        Compression levels for tables can be changed in real time with the ALTER TABLE MOVE statement.
    Database Migration Service --
        A fully-managed service for migrating databases to ADB.
        Provides logical online and offline migration with minimal downtime.
        Validates environment before migration.
        Based on the Oracle Zero Downtime Migration engine utilizing Oracle GoldenGate replication.
Migrating to Autonomous Database:
    Oracle Database Pump --
        is platform independent,
        offers very fast bulk data and metadata movement between Oracle databases and ADB,
        lets you import data from Data Pump files residing on OCI Object Storage, AWS S3, and Azure Blob Storage,
        uses 4 mechanisms to move data in and out of databases,
        expdp / impdp can be used for databases version 10.1 and above,
        can save data to your OCI Object Store and use Oracle Data Pump to load data to ADB,
        on ADB-Dedicated, can import Data Pump files from OCI Object Storage.
    Export an Existing Oracle Database to Import into ADB --
        Recommend schema mode for migrating to ADB to import schemas and ther data.
        Set the parallel parameter to at least the number of OCPUs you have in your Autonomous Database to use parallelism for faster migration.
        The exclude and data_options parameters ensure that object types not required in ADB will not be exported and partitions are grouped together so that they can be imported faster during the import to Autonomous Database.
Q7.1 DBMS_CLOUD.COPY_DATA can be used to load data directly into the existing Autonomous Database tables.
Q7.2 DBMS_CLOUD provide support for loading data from files to tables in Autonomous Database for Azure Blob Storage, Amazon AWS S3, OCI Object Storage
Q7.3 Data Pump and GoldenGate can be used to migrate an on-prem database to Oracle Autonomous Database.
