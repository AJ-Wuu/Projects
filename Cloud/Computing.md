# Basics
## Scalable Compute and Storage Services
* The scalability of Cloud services makes it possible to manage computing infrastructure.  
* Infrastructure is an enterprise's entire collection of hardware, software, networks, facilities and related equipment used in application development, operation, monitoring and / or support of information technology.  
* Managed services / infrastructure: cloud allows firms to add and reduce computing services as needed.
## Distributed Computing for Performance and Reliability
* Virtualization = the form of how the end user will consume it
* Hypervisor allocates the services to individual instances to be consumed by the customer
  * Type 1: runs directly on the hardware and provides the operating system; highly efficient but complex
  * Type 2: manged by the operating system
* Console types
  * Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
    * products are hosted by a third party and made available to users over an internet connection
    * method for delivering software product services based on a subscription model
    * firms are only charged for each user that needs the software products
  * Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
    * delivers development platforms to firms
    * enables firms to run and develop software systems without the complexity having to install and maintain a developer platform
  * Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
    * provides the basic layer of computing
    * closely resembles a typical outsourcing
