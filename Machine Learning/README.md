# Recommender Systems
## Types
* Content-Based: "Show me more of the same of what I've liked before"  
* Collaborative Filtering: "Tell me what's popular among my neighbors, I also might like it"
## Implementation
* Memory-based
  * Uses the entire user-item dataset to generate a recommendation
  * Uses statistical techniques to approximate users or items
  * eg. Pearson Correlation, Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, etc.
* Model-based
  * Develops a model of users in an attempt to learn their preferences
  * Models can be created using Machine Learning techniques like regression, clusteing, classification, etc.
