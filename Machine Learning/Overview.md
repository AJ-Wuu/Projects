# AI, Machine Learning & Deep Learning
## AI
1. makes computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions of humans
2. is a general field with a broad scope including: Computer Vision, Language Processing, Creativity, and Summarization
## Machine Learning
1. the branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial intelligence
2. teaches the computer to solve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples, learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations
### Major Machine Learning Techniques
* Regression/Estimation: predicting continuous values
* Classification: predicting the item class/category of a case
* Clustering: finding the structure of data; summarization; group
* Association: associating frequent co-occurring items/events
* Anomaly Detection: discovering abnormal and unusual cases
* Sequence Mining: predicting next events; click-stream (Markov Model, HMM)
* Dimension Reduction: reducing the size of data (PCA)
* Recommendation Systems: recommending items
## Deep Learning
1. computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own
2. involves a deeper level of automation in comparison with most machine learning algorithms
# Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
## Supervised
* Classification: classifies ***labeled*** data
* Regression: predicates trends using previous ***labeled*** data
* Features:
  * Has more evaluation methods than unsupervised learning
  * Controlled environment
## Unsupervised
* Clustering: finds patterns and groupings from ***unlabeled*** data
* Features:
  * Has fewer evaluation methods than supervised learning
  * Less controlled environment
