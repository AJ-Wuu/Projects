This is an integration project about scheduling multiple broadcasts for YouTube Auto Live Streaming.  
1. Read .json file from the university calendar  
2. Update the Google Calendar accordingly, for the use of the encoder (including Google Calendar API)  
3. Schedule a new broadcast for each event on YouTube with specific settings, like auto-start, auto-stop, NotForKids, etc. (including YouTube Live Streaming API)      
4. All the events of the current date get synchronized once an hour, supporting event insertion, event updation, and event deletion  
5. Future work: use python GUI for a user interface, basically taking in their file name for Google Account Keys, .json source, synchronization frequency, etc.
