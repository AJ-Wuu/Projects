# EXE File
The .exe file doesn't have much practical value (in other words, it only works for my own events and account).  
But it fulfills my curiosity ;)
# py2exe
Open Command Prompt or Terminal, and run ```pip install pyinstaller``` command to install pyinstall  
From the location of .py file, run ```pyinstaller --onefile -w hello_world.py``` command to build and create .exe file from python file.
