*This is a Tetris Game written in Java.  
It mainly uses JFrame, JPanel and Graphics2D as interface.*

**Composition**  
To form the whole project, we need Driver.java, FrameXXMode.java, ButtonsXXMode.java, and BoardXXMode.java.  
The other .java files are used when building the project. They are not called in the final code, but I decided to upload them anyway ðŸ˜œ  

Mode is an "unnecessary" thing here, the only difference in code between AutoMode and ManualMode is in Board.java (however, the name of Frame.java and Buttons.java needs to be changed in this way, )
